            <p>An outbreak of hydropericardium syndrome was recorded in a private poultry farm in Haldwani area of Uttaranchal during January, 2002 with 80% mortality. The course of disease was 8–10 days. Post-mortem examination of dead birds revealed pale and enlarged liver with discrete or diffused necrotic foci. The kidneys were enlarged and congested having necrotic foci throughout. The accumulation of fluid in pericardial sac was invariably recorded in all the affected birds. Histopathological examination of liver revealed necrosis, karyorrhexis and infiltration with mononuclear cells. Isolated hepatocytes also showed distinct and large basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. By electron microscopy, intranuclear adenovirus like particles distributed in paracrystalline arrangement were demonstrated in hepatocytes. The virus was isolated in chicken embryo liver (CEL) cell culture from 20% (w/v) liver homogenate extract collected and prepared from infected birds. The cytopathic effects were characterised by cell rounding and degenerative changes within 24 hours. Isolated hepatocytes also showed presence of large basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, which were confirmed to be avian adenovirus specific by indirect immunofluorescence.</p>

         <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
         <p>Hydropericardium syndrome (HPS), a disease of domestic fowl, is characterised by accumulation of straw-coloured fluid in pericardial sac, in addition to inclusion body hepatitis. In India, the disease was noticed in Jammu and Kashmir during April 1994 and November 1994 and now it poses a major problem in Tarai region of Uttaranchal state, particularly in the district Udham Singh Nagar and Haldwani areas of Nainital district<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">

               <sup>10</sup>
            </xref>. The disease is caused by fowl adenovirus serotype 4, which has been propagated in chicken embryo liver (CEL) and chicken kidney (CK) cell cultures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">

         <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
         <p>An outbreak of HPS occurred at a broiler farm near Haldwani (Uttaranchal) during January 2002 with 80% mortality. Presence of HPS virus in livers from necropsied birds was confirmed by agar gel immunodiffusion test using standard antisera. For detailed study, sick birds were necropsied and tissue samples from liver, heart, kidneys, spleen and bursa of Fabricius were collected in 10% buffered formalin and 2.5% gluteraldehyde for histopathological and electron microscopic studies, respectively. For virus isolation, the samples were collected in 50% glycerine saline.</p>
         <p>Transmission electron microscopy: Tissue samples (liver) fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde were processed for electron microscopic studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">
               <sup>6</sup>
            </xref>. The samples were post fixed in 1% osmium tetra oxide and embedded in Epon 812. Electron microscopic studies were made on thin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips CM 10 transmission electron microscope.</p>
         <p>
            <bold>Virus isolation:</bold> Liver samples collected in 50% glycerine saline were used for virus isolation. After washing liver tissues with Hank‘s balanced salt solution (HBSS), a 20% (w/v) suspension was made in HBSS. After adding antibiotics, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes, supernatant was collected and passed through membrane filter of 0.22 pm pore size and used as inoculum for virus isolation.</p>
         <p>The primary CEL cell culture was prepared according to method of Adair <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">
               <sup>2</sup>
            </xref> with slight modifications using chicken embryos of 14 - 16 days. The cells were cultured in M-199 supplemented with 15% and 2% (v/v) colostrum deprived newborn calf serum in growth and maintenance media, respectively. The growth medium also contained 2% (v/v) tryptose phosphate broth prepared as 1% (w/v) solution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">

            </xref>.</p>
         <p>The confluent monolayers of CEL cells grown in tissue culture bottles and Leighton tubes were inoculated with 1.0 ml and 0.2 ml of virus inocula, respectively. After 3–4 days of infection, the virus was harvested by freezing and thawing three times followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and passed through 0.22 μm membrane filter. It was stored at −20°C to serve as the source of virus for further passages. The infected cover slip cultures were stained with May-Grunwald and Giemsa stains for detailed cellular changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">

         <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
         <p>
            <bold>Clinical signs and gross lesions:</bold> The infected birds exhibited only mild apparent clinical symptoms particularly ruffled feathers and dullness before death. Gross lesions were characterised by accumulation of up to 15 ml straw coloured clear fluid in pericardial sac. The heart was misshapen, flabby and had petechial and ecchymotic haemorrhages in the heart musculature. The lungs were congested and oedematous. The liver was enlarged, friable and had large pale, light gray or yellowish necrotic foci. The kidneys were enlarged, pale yellow and friable. These findings were in agreement with findings of several earlier investigators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">

            </xref>.</p>
         <p>
            <bold>Histopathological changes:</bold> Histologically, the liver showed hyperemia, increase in sinusoid spaces and infiltration of peripheral mononuclear cells and lymphocytes in the portal spaces. The isolated hepatocyte necrosis and small necrotic foci surrounded by inflammatory cells particularly mononuclear cells were invariably seen in the liver. Intranuclear inclusion bodies (IIBs) were found in isolated hepatocytes, in hepatocytes surrounding necrotic areas, and to lesser degree in sinusoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.1</xref>). Hyperemia and focal mononuclear infiltration with occasional IIBs were also observed in kidneys. Numerous IIBs in hepatocytes and occasional IIBs in kidney suggested that virus responsible for HPS possibly infected the hepatocytes more intensely than kidney cells. This finding was also supported by that of Nakamura <italic>et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">
                  <sup>9</sup>
               </xref>
            </italic> who observed occasional IIBs in kidneys suggesting milder infection in comparison to liver. Focal mononuclear cell infiltration and slight oedema were observed in myocardium with separation of muscle bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The spleen revealed varying degrees of lymphocyte depletion, abundant cell debris, pyknosis and karyorrhexis in splenic lymphoid follicles and lymphoid periarteriolar sheaths, but IIBs were not observed. Hyperplasia of macrophages in sheath capillaries was a constant splenic lesion. Lymphocyte depletion in spleen suggested that lymphoid organs were the target organs for HPS virus and also explained the immunosuppressive nature of the virus. Nakamura <italic>et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">
                  <sup>9</sup>
               </xref>
            </italic> also reported changes in the bursa of Fabricius.</p>
         <p>
            <bold>Transmission electron microscopy:</bold> Adenovirus particles were detected ultrastructurally in all cell population containing IIBs. Intranuclear viral particles measured approximately 78–85 nm in diameter and showed three types of virus cores: electron dense, moderately electron-dense and empty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3b">Fig. 3b</xref>). These virions were non-enveloped or naked and were found scattered randomly in the nucleus or aligned in paracrystalline array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3a">Fig. 3a</xref>). Structures associated to virus replication were intranuclear filamentous material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). These findings were similar to those reported by Chandra and Villamandos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">
               <sup>4</sup>
            </xref>. In adenovirus infection of psittacine crystalline arrays as well as loose arrangement of virus particles were earlier demonstrated by Weissenbock and Fuchs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">
               <sup>12</sup>
            </xref>. The size of HPS virus has been estimated to be 65–70 nm by Abe <italic>et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">
                  <sup>1</sup>
               </xref>
            </italic>. This difference might be attributed to strain variation.</p>
         <p>
            <bold>Isolation of virus in cell culture:</bold> The virus was isolated in CEL cell culture, which also produced cytopathic effects (CPE) within 24 h PI in the first passage itself. The CPE was degenerative type and almost all the hepatocytes peeled off from tissue culture flask by 72 h PI. May-Grunwald and Giemsa staining of infected CEL cells showed presence of basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in some hepatocytes within 24 h and by 48 h PI, almost all cells had inclusion bodies, which occupied the entire nucleus. The inclusions were confirmed to be aviadenovirus specific by indirect fluorescence technique. Toro <italic>et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">
                  <sup>11</sup>
               </xref>
            </italic> reported that both CEL and CK cell cultures are suitable for propagation of HPS virus. Basophilic inclusions contained mature virus particles and their staining character was imparted by basic proteins present in their capsid. However, absence of eosinophilic inclusions in the present investigation might be attributed to short course of disease and rapid virus replication.</p>
